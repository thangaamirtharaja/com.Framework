If
    It is used to decide whether a certain statement or block of statements will be executed or not 

Switch Case: 
	Switch case statment is used when we have  N number of options and we may need to perform a different task for each option.
	
Looping Statments:
	for
	while
	do while

for
	For loops in Java are a fundamental control structure used to repeat a block of code a specific number of times
	
While
	The Java while loop is used to iterate a part of the program repeatedly until the specified Boolean condition is true
	
do while	
	Java do-while loop is called an exit control loop. Therefore, unlike while loop and for loop, the do-while check the condition at the end of loop body

Switch case:
		The Java switch statement executes one statement from multiple conditions.
