Inheritance (extends):
	process of acquring properties(data+methods)
	the which one takes - child class
	the which one gives - parent class
	* A child can be a parent of another class
	* A paren can be a child of another class

Types of Inheritance;
	1. Single : A -> B
	2. Multi level : A -> B -> C
	3. Multiple : A + B -> C(Not supported in Java)
	4. heirarical : A -> B, A->C, A->D
	

Polymorphism:
		Polymorphism is the capability of a mathod to do different things based on the object.

		Types:
		1. Static, compile, early binding (Over loading)
		2. Dynamic, runtime, late binding (over ridding)
